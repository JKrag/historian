This is some text at the top of the history file. It should be left alone.

== In Git

This is a release section, representing in-progress (unreleased changes). This
paragraph should be left alone.

=== A Section
* this is an entry in a section

This is more freeform text. A section, like the one above, categorizes the
information in the list below it. Common section names might include things
like "New Features", "Bugfixes", "Minor Enhancements", etc.

=== Another Section
* this is an entry too
* and another entry

== 1.0.0 2009-01-01

This is some freeform text that is part of an entirely different release section.
Specifically, this is release 1.0.0, which it should be possible to find via
'historian status 1.0.0'. The status command should ignore the date.
